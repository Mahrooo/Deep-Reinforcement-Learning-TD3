# TD3 algorithm in deep reinforcement learning
This work has been done as CS591 Deep Learning course project based on "[Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477.pdf)" paper.

### Requirements
To run this algorithm you can make an virtual conda environment

`conda create -n your_env_name python=3.6`

and activate it by

`conda activate your_env_name`

You need to install some modules includes:
`conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch`

`conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib`

`pip install pybullet`
